# deanslist-payouts

This repository contains the list of payouts for the Deanslist discord server.

It's used as a temporary solution to define the structure of the payout files so that we can start working on the UI.

We're not too interested in the accuracy of the data, the goal is to define a data structure.

## TODO

- [ ] Collect 'discordId' from all entries in members.json
- [ ] Define output formats (eg: payouts-by-country.json)
- [ ] Add a script to generate the output files
